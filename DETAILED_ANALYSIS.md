# Unlocking Church Growth: Data Insights from the National Congregations Study

**Author:** Nathan Schaaf  
**Date:** IN PROGRESS

## Objective

Over the past two decades American churches have seen a decline in regular attendance and participation (Jones, 2024). And since the 2019 Covid pandemic, many churches have not recovered from their pre-covid attendance levels. This analysis strives to identify factors that can help increase church attendance. So, how can we increase our church attendance?

## Audience

This analysis is intended for decision-makers within religious congregations, including clergy, religious leaders, elders or board members, program leaders, employees, and committee leaders. These individuals are responsible for worship, programming, and other activities that engage the general congregation or are sponsored by the organization.

## Data Context

The National Congregations Study, Cumulative Dataset (1998, 2006-2007, 2012, and 2018-2019) provides a comprehensive view of congregations across the U.S. and includes a wide range of religious denominations. It includes data from 5,333 samples and 1,083 features, collected over four periods, with some congregations resampled in subsequent interviews. The data was gathered by trained and qualified interviewers conducting either in-person or computer-assisted personal interviews, typically with a clergyperson and staff from each congregation (Chaves, 2021).

## Supporting Points

- **Change:** The primary feature for this analysis is congregational change, focusing on the “Increased” category. This category is a combination of "Increased more than 10 percent" and "Increased less than 10 percent" found in the dataset and will be used to explore variables correlated with an increase in congregation size.
- **Facilities:** The location for worship and general congregational operations is a key aspect of any religious denomination. Many congregations are divesting, finding alternative uses for properties, or combining with other congregations as budgets shrink. The related features included in this dataset are the type of building, interesting art or architecture, remodeling, home schooling, private schooling, and permits.
- **Music:** Music is a core component in most denominations both in worship and other practices. Many historical churches prefer a traditional style of music, while many newer congregations and denominations center around a contemporary musical style. This analysis will review data on the use of various musical instruments and singing during worship services including piano, organ, drums, electric guitar, acoustic guitar, choir, and congregational singing.
- **Staffing:** Almost all congregations have at least one full-time position, the clergyperson. But like non-religious organizations, congregations need to have additional full and part-time positions to accomplish their goals and grow. This analysis will look at full-time and part-time staff in leadership positions other than pastoral roles, such as children’s ministry, young adult ministry, religious education, family ministry, community engagement, outreach, administration, technology, media, spiritual growth, and psychological counseling. It also includes the lead clergyperson’s gender.
- **Worship:** Church and worship service are almost synonymous in most people’s minds. The worship service is also the pinnacle of most weekly church activities. This analysis will explore various attributes of the worship services and sermon (the primary component of the service) such as the number of services per week, length of worship, length of sermons, use of the pulpit, number of speakers, greetings, children’s time, teen involvement, use of robes, humor, programs, overhead projections, streaming, smartphone engagement, communal reading, offerings, and social time.
- **Programs:** Additional religious programs are offered at most churches, and the larger the congregation the more offerings there tend to be. Exploring the more popular offering can help to identify programs that could increase the congregational size. The related features in this dataset include youth group, Sunday school, Bible class, parenting discussions, voter registration events, environmental discussions, new member events, religious teacher training, discussions on race and religion, marriage enrichment, community needs, women's groups, men’s groups, and LGBTQ groups.

## Visualizations

Note that a custom palette is applied so a denomination’s color remains consistent across all visualizations.
